<h1>Feature Description</h1>

<p>Allow users to manage roles and permissions in a way that supports their workflows and content-access policies. Provide users with an easy way to define custom roles and fine-tune permissions without intervention by O'Reilly staff.</p>

<p>The following roles are likely to be fairly common among publishers, but individual permissions may vary from project to project or company to company. I think it's likely that publishers will want to have multiple versions of each: for example, they may want a type of <code>Author</code> role that has fairly limited permissions, while another <code>Author</code> role could be granted a wider range of powers, such as creating a new project). The permissions module should give them this flexibility.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Author</li>
	<li>Reviewer</li>
	<li>Editor</li>
	<li>Production&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Production Manager</li>
	<li>Copyeditor</li>
	<li>Indexer</li>
	<li>Proofreader</li>
	<li>Publisher</li>
	<li>&lt;custom&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>I suggest providing a starter solutions with at least some of these roles in place, with reasonable permissions for each, to get them started.</p>

<p>A few examples:&nbsp;<code>Author</code> may be an all-powerful role in one company, but fairly weak in another. If a company employs a mix of in-house and external <code>copyeditors</code>, they may wish to define permissions two&nbsp;<code>copyeditor</code> roles.</p>

<p>For the way O'Reilly works, the roles <code>Copyeditor</code>, <code>Indexer</code>, and <code>Proofreader</code> would have the same permissions. The arguments I can offer for not simplifying this scheme to a more generic role would be the quick visibility everyone in a project would have through meaningful role names and the possibility that other publishers won't be set up the same way with respect to vendors.</p>

<p>The following are permission categories that I think are relevant. We should flesh this list out as part of the initial discussions before development:</p>

<ul>
	<li>create a new project</li>
	<li>modify any project in a group</li>
	<li>delete own projects</li>
	<li>delete any project in a group</li>
	<li>download own project</li>
	<li>download any project in a group</li>
	<li>create new branch in own project</li>
	<li>create new branch in any project in a group</li>
	<li>merge changes in own project</li>
	<li>merge changes in any project in a group</li>
	<li>view own project metadata/statistics</li>
	<li>view metadata/statists of any project in a group</li>
	<li>invite a new user to own project</li>
	<li>invite new user to any project in a group</li>
	<li>invite a user to a group</li>
	<li>remove collaborator from any project in a group</li>
	<li>remove collaborator from a group</li>
	<li>edit build settings (separate from changing a theme)</li>
	<li>change theme (separate from setting order of chapters in build)</li>
	<li>modify css&nbsp;</li>
	<li>access git url</li>
</ul>

<p>Breaking down permissions in this way could give us finer control than more simple read/write based permissions, although at the cost of complexity.</p>
