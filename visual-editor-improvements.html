<h1>Feature Description</h1>

<p>The visual editor is a key feature of O'Reilly Atlas, and giving users an intuitive, easy-to-learn interface is a significant selling point. If early adopters have difficulty exploring the tool, they may not take full measure of the powerful features under the hood. Once customers are using the tool, most authors, editors, production staff, and vendors are likely to rely on the visual editor. The way we build out the features of this tool has to withstand a great deal of scrutiny and be flexible enough for varied workflows.</p>

<p>This BRD describes our current wishlist of features and orders them in terms of importance and degree of impact. It is likely that the development work on these features will extend across multiple sprints. As more internal and external users begin to rely on Atlas for live production, this list will evolve and probably grow.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
	<li style="box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Better Block Handling in Visual Editor:</strong>&nbsp;Add the ability to promote/demote heading level in visual editor w/o introducing errors in the document structure. It should be able to easily move around block elements in general without jumping into the code editor.</li>
	<li style="box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Better Way to Show Tag Names, Classes, ID's:</strong>&nbsp;The Visual Editor needs a toggle or a way to show the block element names. You need to be able to know what the different tags are without jumping into the code editor.</li>
	<li style="box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Better Way to Add attributes in Visual Editor:</strong>&nbsp;Ability to add attributes in the visual editor, most notably to add &quot;class&quot; attributes when needed for styling.</li>
	<li style="box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Cursor-after-element Problems:</strong>&nbsp;It is sometimes difficult to place the cursor beneath inserted elements to continue editing/writing. The section handling should take this into account.</li>
	<li style="box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Image Button:</strong>&nbsp;Add ability to insert images through more traditional &quot;select file to upload&quot; approach; supported through an easy to find button in UI toolbar. It should also give users the ability to add ALT text. Referenced in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/orm-atlas/issues/876" style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(65, 131, 196);">#876</a>.</li>
	<li style="box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Better Table Manager:</strong>&nbsp;When inserting a table from the visual interface, you initially see a screen of options. There is no way to get back to these options in the UI (have to go to code view). Also add the ability to insert/delete new rows on a table. Referenced in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/orm-atlas/issues/742" style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(65, 131, 196);">#742</a>.</li>
	<li style="box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Redesign Editor Toolbars:</strong>&nbsp;Right now we have a big dropdown with all the HTMLBook elements. We should redesign the toolbar so it's built for HTMLBook, not with HTMLBook as an afterthought.</li>
	<li style="box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Add Basic Format CSS + Buttons:</strong>&nbsp;We need an easy way to add a class to something to make it underlined, strikethrough, superscript, subscript, etc. This would probably be a basic stylesheet that we always include in the builds, and buttons to insert the classes in the editor.</li>
	<li style="box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Show Image File Names in Visual Editor:</strong>&nbsp;Right now it's not possible to see the file name of an image in the visual editor. Add some kind of hover/toggle to show/hide image file names. Referenced in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/orm-atlas/issues/952" style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(65, 131, 196);">#952</a>.</li>
	<li style="box-sizing: border-box;">
	<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 15px 0px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Allow customization of styling toolbar:</strong>&nbsp;Let users add/remove toolbar buttons in the Visual Editor, so they can remove buttons that are not applicable to them. For example, get rid of the &quot;pre&quot; button for fiction publishers</p>
